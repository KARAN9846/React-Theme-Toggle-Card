# React Theme Toggle Card App

This project demonstrates a simple React application featuring a theme toggle button and a card component. The theme toggle button allows users to switch between light and dark themes, while the card component displays product information in a visually appealing manner.

## Components

### Card Component

The `Card` component showcases product details, including an image, product name, rating, and price. It demonstrates the use of Tailwind CSS for styling and provides a visually appealing representation of product information.

### Theme Toggle Button Component

The `ThemeBtn` component implements a theme toggle button that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. It utilizes React Context API to manage theme state and provides a seamless experience for users to customize the application's appearance.
